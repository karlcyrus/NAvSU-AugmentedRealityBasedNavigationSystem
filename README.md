# 📍 NAvSU — Augmented Reality-Based Campus Navigation System Utilizing Dijkstra's Algorithm

**NAvSU** is an Android-based augmented reality (AR) campus navigation system that combines **Niantic Lightship's World Positioning System (WPS)**, **real-time GPS tracking**, and **Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm** to guide users across a university campus. The system constructs a **weighted navigation graph** of geo-referenced campus nodes and edges, computes the optimal route using graph-theoretic pathfinding, then renders directional AR markers anchored to real-world GPS coordinates through the device's camera — enabling intuitive, turn-by-turn outdoor navigation in augmented reality.

> 🖥️ The **Admin Dashboard** (built with Next.js) is maintained in a separate repository: [campus-ar-admin](https://github.com/karlcyrus/campus-ar-admin)

##  How It Works — Technical Overview

###  Localization Pipeline

NAvSU uses a **three-gate localization system** that must all pass simultaneously before AR navigation begins:

1. **Niantic Lightship WPS (World Positioning System)** — Provides centimeter-level world positioning by fusing visual and satellite data. The `ARWorldPositioningManager` reports a `WorldPositioningStatus.Available` state once the device is accurately localized in world space. A **background warmup** runs silently on app launch to prime the WPS pipeline before the user selects a destination.

2. **GPS (Global Positioning System)** — The device's `LocationService` provides real-time latitude/longitude coordinates with a configurable accuracy threshold (default: **≤ 8 meters** horizontal accuracy). GPS is initialized with high-frequency updates (`1s` desired accuracy, `0.5m` distance filter).

3. **Stability Timer** — All three conditions (WPS available, GPS running, accuracy within threshold) must hold continuously for a configurable duration (default: **10 seconds**) before the navigation path is spawned, preventing jitter from transient GPS spikes.

###  Pathfinding — Dijkstra's Algorithm

The campus is modeled as a **weighted undirected graph** stored in `nav_graph.json`:

- **Nodes** — GPS-anchored waypoints across campus, each defined by a unique ID and `(latitude, longitude)` coordinates. Nodes are typed (e.g., waypoint, building entrance) and can reference Points of Interest (POI).
- **Edges** — Weighted connections between nodes, where the weight (`distance_m`) represents the walking distance in meters. Edges support bidirectional traversal.

At navigation start, the system:
1. Reads the user's **live GPS position** `(lat, lng)`.
2. Finds the **nearest graph node** by computing the Haversine distance to every node.
3. Runs **Dijkstra's algorithm** using a priority queue (`SortedList`) to find the shortest path to the destination node.
4. Returns the ordered sequence of node IDs representing the optimal route.

###  Mathematical Functions

**Haversine Formula** — Computes the great-circle distance (in meters) between two GPS coordinates on Earth's surface:

$$d = 2R \cdot \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\phi}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2)\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{2}\right)}\right)$$

Where $R = 6{,}371{,}000\text{m}$ (Earth's mean radius), $\phi$ = latitude, $\lambda$ = longitude.

**Bearing Computation** — Calculates the compass heading (0° = North, 90° = East) from point A to point B for orienting AR arrows:

$$\theta = \text{atan2}\left(\sin(\Delta\lambda)\cos(\phi_2),\ \cos(\phi_1)\sin(\phi_2) - \sin(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2)\cos(\Delta\lambda)\right)$$

###  AR Object Spawning

Once the path is computed, the system spawns three types of AR objects anchored to GPS coordinates via Lightship's `ARWorldPositioningObjectHelper`:

| Object | Placement | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Node Markers** | At each graph node along the path | Marks waypoints and decision points |
| **Interval Arrows** | Every 8m between consecutive nodes (linear interpolation) | Provides continuous directional guidance |
| **Destination Marker** | At the final node | Signals arrival at the destination |

Each object is rotated to face the next node using the computed bearing, and a **distance-based fade system** using the Haversine formula dynamically adjusts object opacity — fully visible within 25m, fully invisible beyond 35m — to reduce visual clutter and save GPU resources.

###  Real-Time Guidance

During active navigation, the system continuously:
- Tracks the user's GPS position
- Identifies the nearest path node
- Updates a **guidance bearing** pointing toward the next node
- Feeds this data to the **minimap** and **navigation UI card** for real-time ETA and distance display
